The update will add a photorealistic 2D Tupolev Tu-134 FO Electrical Panel with fully functioning SPU-7B Interphone Mini Panel used to listen to VOR / ADF Morse Code signals and select COM-1 or COM-2 radios for ATC communications. It is also ready for using Pushback Panel v3.0. The panel also has Pax Sign switches and other Tu-134 buttons and switches.
